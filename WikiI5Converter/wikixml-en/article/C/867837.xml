	<p>The <b>chain pump</b> is type of a water <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org?title=Pump" title="Pump">pump</a> in which several circular discs are positioned on an endless chain. One part of the chain dips into the water, and the chain runs through a tube, slightly bigger than the diameter of the discs. As the chain is drawn up the tube, water becomes trapped between the discs and is lifted to and discharged at the top. Chain pumps were used for centuries in the ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org?title=Ancient_Near_East" title="Ancient Near East">Middle East</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org?title=Classical_Antiquity" title="Classical Antiquity">Europe</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org?title=Ancient_China" title="Ancient China">China</a>. </p>

	<p>Chain pumps were also used in ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org?title=China" title="China">China</a> from at least the 1st century A.D. In China, they were also called <i>dragon backbones</i>.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 89 110">

Illustrations of such Chinese chain pumps show them drawing water up a slanted channel.

	<p>From the 1st century onwards, chain pumps were widespread throughout the Chinese countryside.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 110">

	<p>During the period of agricultural expansion in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org?title=Song_Dynasty" title="Song Dynasty">Song China</a> (10th-13th centuries CE), the technology of water-rising devices was improved. For some centuries they had been used for moving water for drainage or irrigation purposes. The simplest design, known as the counterbalanced bucket or &#39;swape&#39; or &#39;well-sweep&#39; was in common use at that time. A more complicated design, the &#39;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org?title=Chain_pump" title="Chain pump">square-pallet chain pump</a>&#39;, was introduced several centuries before the growth in Song technology, but had not seen prior use for farming. They became more common around the end of the first millennium AD.<ref>

	<p>From the 13th century onwards, the Chinese also used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org?title=Windmill" title="Windmill">windmills</a> (acquired from the Middle East) to power square-pallet chain pumps.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 558">
	<p>Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, p. 558.</p></ref> Yet there were other types of chain pumps besides the square-pallet design. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org?title=Song_Yingxing" title="Song Yingxing">Song Yingxing</a>&#39;s (1587–1666) encyclopedic book the <i>Tiangong Kaiwu</i> (1637), there is description and illustration of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org?title=Cylinder_(geometry)" title="Cylinder (geometry)">cylinder</a> chain pump, powered by waterwheels and leading water up from the river to an elevated plain of agricultural crops.<ref name="song 15">
	<p>Song, 15.</p></ref></p> 
	<p>The contribution of chain pumps to agricultural growth during the Song was extolled by poets such as Li Chuquan (李处权) of the twelfth century. The Song government actively spread the technology, introducing pumping equipment and chain pumps to those areas as yet unfamiliar with the technique.<ref>
